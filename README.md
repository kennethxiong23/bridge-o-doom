# Robot Simulation Project Documentation

This repository contains the MATLAB code and associated files for a robot simulation project. It includes the main scripts, functions, and data required to simulate and analyze the robot's movement and sensor data.

## Repository Contents

- `NeatoVelocities.m`: A MATLAB script provided by the instructor to calculate velocities of the Neato robot.
- `bofd_robot_sim.asv`: An autosave file for the main robot simulation script, provided by the instructor.
- `bofd_robot_sim.m`: The main robot simulation MATLAB script provided by the instructor.
- `brdDoom.mlx`: The live script containing the code used for controlling and simulating the robot.
- `brdDoom.pdf`: A PDF export of the `brdDoom.mlx` live script for easy viewing and sharing.
- `data.mat`: A MATLAB data file containing the collected data from robot simulations.
- `graphs/`: A directory containing graphs in JPG format that visualize various aspects of the robot's performance.
- `judp.m`: A MATLAB function provided by the instructor for UDP communication.
- `matlab.mat`: A MATLAB data file with dependencies for the robot simulation, provided by the instructor.
- `myRobotProgram.m`: A MATLAB script provided by the instructor with robot program routines.
- `neato.m`: A MATLAB script provided by the instructor for Neato robot simulation.
- `NeatoSensors.m`: A MATLAB function provided by the instructor to simulate Neato robot sensors.
- `neatoSim.m`: A MATLAB script provided by the instructor for simulating the Neato robot.

## Usage

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine and open the files in MATLAB. Ensure you have all the dependencies installed as provided by the instructor. The main entry point for the simulation is `bofd_robot_sim.m`.

## Data Visualization

The `graphs` folder contains visualizations of the robot's performance. These include plots of angular velocity, linear speed over time, and individual wheel velocities. Refer to the individual JPG files for detailed legends and captions.
